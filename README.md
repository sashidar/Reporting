### AidStream stands as one such platform, that presents complexity of the IATI in an understandable and a consumable way.

User friendly interfaces within the platform enhance an effortless entry, update and publish of the aid data in the IATI format for organisations that want to publish IATI data. The system hides all the complexities and technicalities of the xml. With AidStream, the necessity to understand the details of the IATI standard becomes lesser. All that needs to be done is to register into the system, enter the data and publish it. The data will be easily published to the IATI registry . In addition, AidStream guarantees high security, proper maintenance and easy accessability of the aid data.

## Check code quality

We follow [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) for 
coding standard. To check if your code 
matches the projects quality checks please see [codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/55f540606956805fc2010677/feed).

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/55f540606956805fc2010677/badges/dab7b46f5a489b6104ed/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/repos/55f540606956805fc2010677/feed)

## Tests

There are two types of tests for AidStream, one for unit testing and other one is smoke testing with Hookah library.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are in the `tests\app` folder. They can be run with the following command:

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/app 
```

### Smoke Tests with Hookah

Smoke tests are in the `tests\Smoke` folder, they can be run with the following commands:

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Smoke 
```

To run the tests faster in parallel run it with paraunit like below:

```
./vendor/bin/paratest --colors -m 2 -p 4 --stop-on-failure --path= tests/Smoke
```

## Continuous Integration

On each push the hookah test will run on [Wercker](https://app.wercker.com/#applications/560f9c92d77c55dc7303a957) CI. It
also sends notification to hipchat on [Build-Bot](https://yipl.hipchat.com/chat/room/1267700) room. Tests run on Wercker's 
Docker setup.

## Integration with Gitomate

[Gitomate](http://gitlab.yipl.com.np/internal/gitomate) is an application that automates other actions after a git push 
is done with special tags.

To open a merge request you can simply do it with adding `#mr` to the commit message. It will open a merge request for 
you. If it does not open in the first push try doing a commit amend and force push or make changes with a second commit
and do a second push.

Gitomate will also run a code climate analysis for the branch on each push on [code climate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/55f540606956805fc2010677/branches).
